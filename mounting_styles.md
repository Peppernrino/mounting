# Mounting styles

A list of recommended methods for mounting radio transceivers on permanent structures.

## Existing structures

Ideally, you should attempt to mount to existing structures,

## Do mount to:
* an old satellite dish mount (you can even help out the home owner by removing an old, unused dish)
* a solid chimney that is rarely used (ideally never used) 
* a solid vent pipe that is unused (i.e. does it get hot?)
* a drain pipe or downspout, ideally water tight (i.e. no leaks)
* a spire, weathervane, or other decorative structure (should be well secured).
* a tree?

## Do NOT mount to:
* electrical conduit, could cause electro-magnetic interference 
* TV antennas
* solar panels (they are expensive and senstive equipment, avoid touching at all)
* any pipe that does not feel solid (i.e. moves when you shake it)

## Added structures
If a roof does not have any good exisitng mount points, then you may need add a mounting structure,

### Non-penetrating mounts
If possible, it is ideal to perform a non-penetrating roof mount. Here are some good options,
* a weighted based, the [Solid Signal EZ-NP-60-125](https://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?p=EZ-NP-60-125) is good for flat roofs, you'll also want a [mat to go underneath](https://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?p=NPRMAT8) and some dead weight (concrete blocks, sandbags, e-waste?)
* a chimney mount, the [Skywalker Signature Series Mount](http://www.skywalker.com/Products/Skywalker-Signature-Series-Y-Type-Chimney-Mount-Kit-for-Antennas-18ft-Steel-Straps-and-Hardware-Included__SKY6027.aspx) is highly recommended, [see here for how to use it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudomesh/mounting/master/images/chimney_mount.jpg)

### Penetrating mounts
If there are no other options, then you may need physcially attach something to the structure. You can fastened to the side of a structure, or super-structure (wood siding, concrete wall, brick, etc.), one of the following,
* a J-Pole, ideal for sides of house (add example photo), see [Solid Signal J-Mount](https://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?p=SSJMOUNT)
* a strut and mast, good for super-structures (add a picture of this setup and parts list?)

# Ask first!
No matter what mount style you plan to use, always ask permission of the building or home owner before mounting equipment.
