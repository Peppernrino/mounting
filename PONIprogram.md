# Welcome to the People's Open Node Installer (PONI) Program

People's Open Node Installers, affectionately known as PONIs, are individuals capable of facilitating the installation of a mesh node for the People's Open Network. 

1. Participate in a Node Mount Training and Safety Explanation session (either at the Omni or on-site)

2. Contribute to at least one (ideally two) node mounts, this means going along, learning the steps, becoming familiar with equipment, and interacting with the node owner. 

3. Facilitate at least one node mount, this means finding someone from our list (or just a friend, family member, co-worker) whoâ€™d like a node, scheduling the installation, performing day-of coordination, and completing the install. 

4. Teach another potential PONI to become a certified PONI.
