# Mounting Extender Nodes

_work in progress_

related to all things mounting - equipment, prep, knowledge share

## Questions to ask at the very beginning

* Where do you want to mount your extender node? Do you know what you are aiming at?
* Do you have a group of people to do the mount with? Ideally between two and four people, with at least one having done an install before.
* Have you had any safety training? At the least, brush up on OHSA guidelines.
* Do your research using publicly available GIS information (i.e. Google Earth)

## Scouting the location

* Do you have a contact on site, and are they available.
* Do you have roof access? Are there any local zoning or home owners associate considerations?
* Is there actually a good place to mount the antenna?
* Can you actually see the node you are aiming for? Line of sight is key!
  * Easy check is, can you see a peoplesopen-node2node ssid
* Explain the mounting process to the contact. Include things like where the equipment will get mounted and how cables will pass into the building.
* Make sure contact information is exchanged so you can coordinate the actual install at a future time.
* Plot your anticipated cable run

## Flashing Routers

* Always flash the routers prior to getting on site. If possible, run makenode prior to getting on site.
* Make sure you have the right power adapter for what you are installing!
* Follow the [walkthrough](https://peoplesopen.net/walkthrough)
* Flash backup equipment if possible. Always good to have a spare to save a potential second (Well, third if you count the scouting trip) visit

## Prior to Mounting

* Do you have all your tools?
  * Cable testers
  * A drill suitable for what you will be putting holes in
  * Spare extender / home node
* Make sure you will have a contact on site

## Actually On Site

* With four people you can have two doing the actual install, one person acting as a spotter for safety hazards, and a fourth interacting with the contact on site.
  * At least one person should have done this before
  * At least one person should have been on the scouting trip
* Always explain to the contact on site what the plan will be. Even if you've done it before. Consent is important.
* Test equipment before mounting it. Battery powered PoE injectors can be helpful here.
  * This goes for both the extender and mesh nodes
* Confirm the actual cable run. Never put holes in a roof for cables always in a wall.
  * Keep in mind max cat5 lengths. Generally aim for 300' max.
  * Make sure to use shielded/grounded cable outside
  * Leave a "drip loop" where the cable goes into the building. This is a downward curve of the cable which helps water not enter the building.
  * If desired by site contact, you can use conduit or panduit for aesthetics
* If you will be crawling around in attics you may wish to have a respirator
* When mounting extender nodes, the POE sheath should be pointing down. This will ensure the LED's are not pointing up, as they apparently attract birds.
* Exchange contact information with the site contact before leaving
